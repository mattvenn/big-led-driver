# Big 7 segment driver

Python driver for the [TLC5916](http://www.ti.com/product/tlc5916), a constant current, 8 bit driver, designed for daisy chaining.

# PCB

Available from [OSH park](http://oshpark.com/shared_projects/hZyNfTTa), hopefully will find a way to make them cheaper soon!

# Example

    import driver
    driver.update("0.35") #requires 3 panels
